# Hands-On Guide

## Exercise 8: Documentation

### **Goal**

To generate comments for our code and use them to create HTML-based documentation.
 

### **Steps**

1. Create a new chat session, selecting “**Keep & Continue**” when asked.

2. In the left-hand side _**EXPLORER**_ pane, right-click on the `/src` folder and select _**Copilot > Add Folder to Chat**_.

3. Enter the following prompt into the Chat window and hit **Enter**:

   > _Find .ts files without existing documentation_

3. Once Copilot has answered, start entering the following command into the Chat window, select the command from the menu, and hit **Enter:**  

   > `/document-typescript-code`

5. Once complete, create a new chat session, selecting “**Keep & Continue**” when asked.

6. In the left-hand side _**EXPLORER**_ pane, right-click on the `/src/components` folder and select _**Copilot > Add Folder to Chat**_.

8. Start entering the following command into the Chat window, select the command from the menu, and hit **Enter:**  

   > `/document-react-components`

9. Once complete, create a new chat session, selecting “**Keep & Continue**” when asked.

10. In the left-hand side _**EXPLORER**_ pane, right-click on the `/src` folder and select _**Copilot > Add Folder to Chat**_.

11. Enter the following prompt into the Chat window and hit **Enter**:

      > _Help me generate Type Doc HTML documentation for both the .ts and .tsx files_

12. Follow the on-screen prompts, answering Copilot's questions as they arise.

13. Open the `/docs/index.html` in a web browser to view the documentation.


### **Outcome**

You'll see HTML-based documentation has been generated for the codebase.
