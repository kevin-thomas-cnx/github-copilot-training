# Test Generation Instructions
- Write unit tests with at least 90% coverage for new features.
- When generating tests, use Jest and prioritize unit tests over integration tests.
- Always run unit tests after implementing a new feature to ensure functionality.
- Use `pnpm run test:unit` to run unit tests. This will include a coverage report.
- Use `pnpm run test:e2e` to run end-to-end tests.
