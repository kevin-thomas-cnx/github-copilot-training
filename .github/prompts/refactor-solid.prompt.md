Review my codebase through the lens of the **SOLID principles of object-oriented design**:
​
- **Identification:**
  - Areas where my code violates any of the SOLID principles:
    - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Classes or methods doing too much.
    - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Code that is hard to extend without modifying.
    - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subclasses that don’t function as drop-in replacements for their parent classes.
    - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Classes forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use.
    - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules directly depending on low-level modules or concrete implementations.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Actionable refactoring or redesign suggestions to better align my code with each SOLID principle.
  - Specific advice on reorganizing classes, interfaces, dependencies, or class hierarchies.
- **Explanation:**
  - The reasoning and benefits behind each recommendation, such as improved flexibility, testability, robustness, and maintainability.
- **Examples:**
  - Before-and-after code snippets or pseudocode to demonstrate how principles can be applied in context.
