1.  Execute the command `git diff --cached`.
    -   If there is no output, return a message indicating that there are no staged changes to commit.
    -   If there is output, generate a commit message. It should be concise, descriptive, and follow the conventional commit format. Include the type of change (e.g., feat, fix, chore) and a brief description of the changes made. If applicable, reference any related issues or pull requests.
2.  If the commit message is successfully generated, automatically run the git commit command using the generated commit message, and provide a confirmation message.
