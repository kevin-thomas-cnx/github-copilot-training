Review my existing codebase with a focus on the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle**. I’d like your help to:
​
- **Identify**:
  - Areas with code duplication, repeated logic, or patterns that could be consolidated.
- **Recommend**:
  - Actionable refactoring steps to minimize repetition.
  - Code-level and architectural suggestions for improving DRYness.
- **Explain**:
  - The benefits of each proposed change (e.g., improved maintainability, readability, reduced chance of bugs).
- **Illustrate**:
  - Provide example refactored code or pseudocode where appropriate.
​
Organize your feedback clearly by duplication area or pattern, and prioritize the most impactful improvements.
